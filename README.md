# Face Recognition Project

## Overview

This is a Face Recognition project that uses [insert technology/library/tool] to detect and recognize faces in images. The system is designed to perform accurate and efficient face recognition for various applications.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes [insert face detection library/tool] to locate faces in images.
- **Face Recognition:** Implements [insert face recognition library/tool] for recognizing faces based on pre-trained models or user-defined datasets.
- **User Authentication:** Integrates face recognition for secure user authentication.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition.git
    cd face-recognition
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. [Additional steps if any, such as downloading pre-trained models or datasets.]

## Usage

1. [Provide examples and code snippets on how to use your project.]
2. [Include information on how to train new models if applicable.]
3. [Specify any configurations or settings that users might need to modify.]

## Example

```python
# Example code snippet demonstrating how to use the face recognition module

import face_recognition

# Load an image with faces
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("path/to/image.jpg")

# Find all face locations in the image
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

# Recognize faces
face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(image, face_locations)

# [Do something with the recognized faces]
